# Vis Bytepos

This is a simple plugin for [vis](https://github.com/martanne/vis)
that will show the byte offset the main cursor is located at. To use
this plugin, simply copy `bytepos.lua` to `~/.config/vis/` and then add
the following line to `visrc.lua`:

    require('bytepos')

To display the cursor position once the plugin is loaded, simply type
`gi` when in normal mode.
